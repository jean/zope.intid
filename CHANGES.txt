3.7.1 (unreleased)
------------------

- Remove a dependency on ``zope.container.contained.Contained``
  (this is a dumb base class that defines __parent__ and __name__
  as None and declares that the class implements IContained).

3.7.0 (2009-02-01)
------------------

- Split out this package from ``zope.app.intid``. The latter one
  now only contains browser views and compatibility imports while
  whole IntId functionality is moved here.
